Project Title

	Youtube downloader (MP4 + MP3)

Project Description

	I create this application because most of the time I listen to songs and other information on youtube and I want to download them on my pc, one reason for this is to listen to that content when I am offline, ex in my car. Youtube gives the possibility to download its content only if you pay for a premium subscription. But if I am a junior programmer why don't create an application to do this for free and one that can be installed on my pc? This is the motivation behind this project.
	If you like to download content on youtube (video or only audio) feel free to use this application.

How to Install and Run the Application

	This application can be downloaded on your PC on the youtube_downloader.exe file and after the new page opens click to download. After the download is finished it can be opened by double-clicking it. Sometimes can appear a blue color window because this application is not created under a license, so need to click More Info and after that Run Anyway.

How to Use the Project

	After the application is open you will notice two empty fields, one for the link of the video, and one for the place on your computer where you want to save the file after download. First, need to be filled with the link of the video from Youtube, second will be filled after you click Browse and chose the folder on your computer where you want to save the video or sounds you will download.
	In the end when all the first two fields are filed all you have to do is to choose pressing one of the download buttons, the Download Video button if you want an mp4 format of the file, or Download MP3 if you want mp3 format of the file.
	After you follow all the steps below only need to wait a few seconds to download the file after you will find the file in the location chosen on the second file.
